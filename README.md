# Vitual Map IIIT Delhi
This is a rudimentary virtual map of IIIT Delhi implemented with the help of Unity , a cross-platform game engine . The goal is to make a fully functional system that allows visitors to navigate the campus easily. This is just the virtual map section of the system. A functioning system can be found at : https://github.com/kshitijg2903/kshitijg2903-vns-system 

This project is still in its early stages.
